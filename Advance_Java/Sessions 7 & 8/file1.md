Q1. What is JDBC?

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language,
and a wide range of databases.

The JDBC library includes APIs for each of the tasks mentioned below that are commonly associated with database usage. 

 Making a connection to a database.  Creating SQL or MySQL statements. 

 Executing SQL or MySQL queries in the database. 

 Viewing & Modifying the resulting records.

Fundamentally, JDBC is a specification that provides a complete set of interfaces that allows for portable access to an underlying database. 
Java can be used to write different types of executables, such as:

 Java Applications

 Java Applets

 Java Servlets

 Java ServerPages (JSPs)

 Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs).

All of these different executables are able to use a JDBC driver to access a database, and take advantage of the stored data.
