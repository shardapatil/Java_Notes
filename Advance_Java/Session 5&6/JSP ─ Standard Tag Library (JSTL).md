                                                        Classification of The JSTL Tags

The JSTL tags can be classified, according to their functions, into the following JSTL tag library groups that can be used when creating a JSP page:

 Core Tags

 Formatting tags

 SQL tags

 XML tags

 JSTL Functions

                                                              Core Tags
                                                              
The core group of tags are the most commonly used JSTL tags. 

Following is the syntax to include the JSTL Core library in your JSP:

``` <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %> ```

The JSTL formatting tags are used to format and display text, the date, the time, and numbers for internationalized Websites. 
Following is the syntax to include Formatting library in your JSP:

``` <%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %> ```

The JSTL SQL tag library provides tags for interacting with relational databases (RDBMSs) such as Oracle, mySQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.
Following is the syntax to include JSTL SQL library in your JSP:

``` <%@ taglib prefix="sql" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" %> ```

The JSTL XML tags provide a JSP-centric way of creating and manipulating the XML documents. 
Following is the syntax to include the JSTL XML library in your JSP.
The JSTL XML tag library has custom tags for interacting with the XML data. This includes parsing the XML, transforming the XML data, and the flow control based on the XPath 
expressions.

``` <%@ taglib prefix="x" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/xml" %> ```

                                                          JSTL Functions
                                                          
JSTL includes a number of standard functions, most of which are common string manipulation functions. 
Following is the syntax to include JSTL Functions library in your JSP:

``` <%@ taglib prefix="fn" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions" %> ```

Following table lists out the various JSTL Functions:
